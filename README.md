# Welcome, My Name is Yatri Trivedi

I am a backend developer (python primarily) who also works with DevOps technologies.

Check out my pinned repositories for some examples of the kinds of things I've done. The most interesting thing I worked on extracurricularly is:
* I created an updated mechanism of sending odd keycode combinations for the QMK firmware targeting the Planck EZ Glow keyboard
* This allows one to use it alongside AutoHotKey for use as macro board, stream deck, etc.

I am a programmer and IT specialist who has vetted, onboarded, and integrated various SaaS solutions for small and mid-size companies in the AI/ML SaaS, e-commerce, shipping, and inventory management spaces. I have been using Python (3.5+) to solve problems in numerous operations for about five years. Prior to and alongside my software development projects, I was a project manager for several internal software products and I also served as a mentor for numerous beginner programmers through a bootcamp program. My most recent experience is centered around backend technologies such as RESTful APIs, microservices, and ETL processes. Prior to that, I gained deep experience in writing programs and integrations for ecommerce and business-related domains such as:
* inventory management
* shipping
* physical product refurbishment
* technical support
* invoicing
* price tracking
* customer solutions
* long-term relationship management.

Most recently, I worked for SupportLogic.io as a backend developer, focusing on the ETL/ELT processes in the data ingestion system, also working on a replacement for our data import tool.

### My Tools of Choice

* Python (preferably 3.8+), though I'm not a stranger to JavaScript/ES6 and shell scripting as well
* Django, though I'm familiar with Flask
* FastAPI
* Pandas, Bokeh, MatPlotLib for reporting/data
* PostgreSQL (sometimes MySQL)
* Click, Rich, tqdm for command-line
* Linux/Debian, though I'm familiar with Windows and Mac OS
* Docker for deployed code
* Git for version control

### My Experience

I have a 6+ years of experience in:
* programming in `Python 3+`
* designing, documenting, and consuming `RESTful APIs`
* creating command-line applications
* creating `Django and Flask` apps
* querying `databases` and using `Pandas` to write reports
* `AWS` backend development (EC2/RDS/Lambda/Cloudwatch)
* QA
* `documenting` existing code
* documenting on-the-ground `processes` and...
  * streamlining them
  * supporting them with internal tools
  * suggesting and adapting to new changes and processes
* vetting, integrating, and supporting `SaaS` solutions for company needs, customers, and high-profile business clients
* using `low code`/`no code` tools and training departments to use them effectively
* working in secure environments

I also have been a Linux user in some form since 1999!
* I have 12 years of experience with Ubuntu, and I find myself at home on Debian and Debian-derived distros.
* I've self-hosted tons of applications:
  * SubSonic (music library streamer)
  * Calibre (ebook library)
  * Calibre-web (a secondary spotify-inspired interface for Calibre)
  * Plex (video and photo library streamer)
  * Wallabag (Pocket/ReadItLater clone)
  * DokuWiki (wiki systems with access controls and plugins)
* Experience setting up TLS and using NGINX reverse-proxies for a variety of reasons
* SSH/RClone/Rsync/etc
* Redhat 6 was my first, but I quickly moved to SuSE then Mandrake due to issues with my WinSoft modem.
* Jumped onboard with Ubuntu with Dapper Drake (6.06), tried derivations, and moved to hyper-minimalist Debian distros (BunsenLabs)
* Can install and use Arch if required

### Key Achievements

* Organized and project managed a hackathon group, taking an idea for a self-serve onboarding tool starting at defining stages and through to MVP. (SupportLogic 2022)
* Created in-depth documentation targeted at DevOps for the triage, logging, and resolution of critical customer ETL processes. (SupportLogic 2022)
* Mentored and guided 2 junior devs through onboarding and critical triage practices, directly decreasing customer response time. (SupportLogic 2022)
* Mentored, educated, and prepared five beginner-level students at Rmotr for Junior Developer positions, kickstarting their career changes. (Rmotr 2016)
* Analyzed a process for returns management that utilized 12 staff members between 3 departments and 4 managers that used Google Docs and created a no/low code database application in 5 weeks, which tripled staff output, saved roughly $20,000/month, and increased customer satisfaction by 22%. (Spytec GPS 2018)
* Wrote for How-To Geek, author page: [YatriTrivedi](https://www.howtogeek.com/author/yatritrivedi/)
* Held both Secretary and President-equivalent board positions in multiple organizations.
