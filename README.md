# Welcome, My Name is Yatri Trivedi

I am a backend developer (python primarily) who also works with DevOps technologies.

Check out my pinned repositories for some examples of the kinds of things I've done.

I am a programmer and IT specialist who has vetted, onboarded, and integrated various SaaS solutions for small and mid-size companies in the e-commerce, shipping, and inventory management spaces. I have been using Python (3.5+) to solve problems in numerous operations for about five years. Prior to and alongside my software development projects, I was a project manager for several internal software products and I also served as a mentor for numerous beginner programmers through a bootcamp program. I have deep experience in ecommerce-related domains such as inventory management, shipping, physical product refurbishment, and technical support, as well as business-focused domains such as invoicing, price tracking, customer solutions, and long-term relationship management.

### My Tools of Choice

* Django, though I'm familiar with Flask
* Pandas, Bokeh, MatPlotLib for reporting/data
* PostgreSQL (sometimes MySQL)
* Click, Rich, tqdm for command-line
* Linux/Debian, though I'm familair with Windows and Mac OS
* Git for version control

### My Experience

I have a 5+ years of experience in:
* programming in `Python 3+`
* designing, documenting, and consuming `RESTful APIs`
* creating command-line applications
* creating `Django and Flask` apps
* querying `databases` and using `Pandas` to write reports
* `AWS` backend development (EC2/RDS/Lambda/Cloudwatch)
* QA
* `documenting` existing code
* documenting on-the-ground `processes` and...
  * streamlining them
  * supporting them with internal tools
  * suggesting and adapting to new changes and processes
* vetting, integrating, and supporting `SaaS` solutions for company needs, customers, and high-profile business clients
* using `low code`/`no code` tools and training departments to use them effectively
* working in secure environments

I also have been a Linux user in some form since 1999!
* I have 12 years of experience with Ubuntu, and I find myself at home on Debian and Debian-derived distros.
* I've self-hosted tons of applications:
  * SubSonic (music library streamer)
  * Calibre (ebook library)
  * Calibre-web (a secondary spotify-inspired interface for Calibre)
  * Plex (video and photo library streamer)
  * Wallabag (Pocket/ReadItLater clone)
  * DokuWiki (wiki systems with access controls and plugins)
* Experience setting up TLS and using NGINX reverse-proxies for a variety of reasons
* SSH/RClone/Rsync/etc
* Redhat 6 was my first, but I quickly moved to SuSE then Mandrake due to issues with my WinSoft modem.
* Jumped onboard with Ubuntu with Dapper Drake (6.06), tried derivations, and moved to hyper-minimalist Debian distros (BunsenLabs)
* Can install and use Arch if required

### Key Achievements

* Mentored, educated, and prepared five beginner-level students at Rmotr for Junior Developer positions, kickstarting their career changes. (Rmotr 2016)
* Analyzed a process for returns management that utilized 12 staff members between 3 departments and 4 managers that used Google Docs and created a no/low code database application in 5 weeks, which tripled staff output, saved roughly $20,000/month, and increased customer satisfaction by 22%. (Spytec GPS 2018)
* Held both Secretary and Vice President equivalent board positions in organizations.
